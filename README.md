# Password Generator and Clipboard Manager

This JavaScript code implements a simple web application for generating secure passwords and managing clipboard operations. The code is designed for use in a web page and is controlled by several buttons and input fields.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Clicking the "Generate Password" button generates a random password based on the specified length and character set, which includes numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and special characters.

- **Password Length Control**: Users can specify the desired password length using the input field labeled "Password Length."

- **Clipboard Copy**: Clicking the "Copy Password" button copies the generated password to the clipboard and provides a success alert when the operation is successful. An error alert is displayed in case of any issues.

- **Clipboard Paste**: The generated password can be pasted into another input field (labeled "Confirm Password") when that input field is focused. Additionally, users can click the "Paste Password" button to paste the password from the clipboard into the "Confirm Password" field.

- **Password Length Validation**: There's validation to ensure that the specified password length is between a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 64 characters. An alert is displayed if the length is outside this range.

## Usage

To use this code, you can integrate it into an HTML file and include the necessary HTML elements and CSS styling for buttons and input fields.
